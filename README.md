CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, a money management system that incorporates 
a pie chart visualization of expenses can be a powerful tool for 
individuals to track and manage their spending habits 
effectively. By representing expenditure data in a pie chart 
format, the system provides a visually appealing and easily 
understandable overview of where money is being allocated.
The pie chart serves as a snapshot of spending distribution 
across different categories, such as dineout, entertainment, 
hospital, and travel. This visual representation enables users to 
quickly identify their major spending areas and gain insights 
into their financial priorities. It facilitates a better 
understanding of how financial resources are being utilized 
and allows individuals to make informed decisions about their 
spending habits.
By regularly updating and monitoring the pie chart, users can 
track their progress towards financial goals and objectives. It 
helps individuals to evaluate their current financial situation 
and make necessary adjustments as needed. For instance, if the 
pie chart reveals that a significant portion of the budget is 
being allocated to dine out expenses, individuals can choose to 
reduce dining out and reallocate those funds to other 
categories or savings.
Moreover, the pie chart-based money management system 
promotes financial literacy and awareness. It encourages 
individuals to actively engage with their financial data, 
analyze patterns and trends, and develop a better 
understanding of their own financial behaviors. This increased 
awareness empowers individuals to make informed decisions, 
establish budgets, and take control of their financial wellbeing.

In summary, a money management system that incorporates a 
pie chart visualization provides individuals with a clear, 
concise, and visually appealing representation of their 
expenditure data. It enhances financial literacy, supports 
informed decision-making, and enables individuals to track 
their progress towards financial goals. By utilizing such a 
system, individuals can take control of their finances and 
improve their overall financial well-being.
